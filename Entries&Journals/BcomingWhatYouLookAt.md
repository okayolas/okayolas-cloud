# Becoming What You Look At

## Signal-to-Noise Ratio
**Focus on the Few Things that Make the Biggest Difference:**

- Where attention goes, energy flows  
- Where energy flows, life grows  

The ability to focus on what truly matters makes all the difference.

## The Law Behind This
Where your attention goes, energy flows.  
Your consistent focus sends a signal to the universe â€” this is what gets mirrored back to you.

---

## The Trap of Negative Focus
- If you keep looking at whatâ€™s wrong, youâ€™ll keep manifesting more of it.  

**Tightrope analogy:**  
- Look down â†’ more likely to fall  
- Focus on the tightrope â†’ move forward slowly and steadily

## What You Observe Repeatedly, You Energize
- Repetition = Reality  
- The subconscious mind believes what it sees the most  
- You become what you normalize  
- Youâ€™re always manifesting â€” even unintentionally  

**Social media feeds (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram)** are good examples of subconscious manifestation:  
- Complaints, lack, fear â€” all plant seeds in your mind  
- Choose what you look at wisely  

---

## If You Want a New Reality
- Look differently (literally)  
- Focus on possibility, not limitation  
- Donâ€™t just react to life â€” direct it with your gaze  

---

## Vision as a Manifestation Tool
You donâ€™t manifest by forcing.  
You manifest by consistently seeing the version of life you choose.  

- Use your eyes and **FOCUS**  
- Focus by saying no to distractions  
- Focus is a skill: manifest through sight and vision

## Create a Focus Routine

**Morning:**  
- Visualize the life you are choosing  

**Daytime:**  
- Stop checking what you donâ€™t want  

**Night:**  
- Replay your desires before sleeping  

ðŸ‘‰ Focus on specific desires â€” start small.  

---

## Mirror Work Magic
- Look at yourself daily  
- Affirm: *"I am becoming everything I once hoped for."*  

---

## Protect Your Gaze Like a Sacred Portal
- Unfollow what dims your vision  
- Unplug from what drains you  
- Unlearn what holds you back  

---

**Your eyes are the gateway to your energy.**
