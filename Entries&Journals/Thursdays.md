## Friday Eve

Thursday is not only my favorite day of the week but the **proven** best day of the week. It feels like the turning point—the pinnacle of everything wonderful and lovely in the world.  

To me, Thursday has always been **Friday** Eve. And Friday Eve (Thursday) has always felt like the true end of a week.  

Here’s why: the anticipation of school letting out, everyday workers clocking out at five, and the sun setting as people pour out of their daily routines is unmatched on a Friday. Fridays carry the highest vibrations—they already feel like the weekend. Fridays hold the anticipation and excitement of what’s to come. Because of that, Thursday already feels like the end of the week to me.  

Even for those not about the 9-5 life or not in school, all of this still stands. You get closer to whatever your heart desires on Thursdays. If you are a fan of Friday's you are a fan of Friday eve. It is a special day. 

Loving Thursdays and their sheer existence makes Wednesdays so much more bearable, leaving only Monday and Tuesday as the “rseal” days to push through. And honestly, Mondays aren’t even that bad, since everyone is just easing back into the swing of things.  

Thursday is the best day of the week. Wednesday is just the lead-up, Thursday carries the beautiful anticipation of Friday, and then BOOM—the weekend.  

I fucking love Thursdays.
