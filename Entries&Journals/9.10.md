# Understanding Consequence

When it comes to **Charlie Kirk**, the question of “deserving” isn’t even the point.  
He spent over a decade building a platform that divided people, dehumanized communities, and weaponized fear.  

For years, he played with fire — and this is what happens when you play with fire long enough.  
These go beyond opinions, talking points, and points of view as he funded organizations that fueled **anti-immigration, anti-LGBTQ+, anti-Black, and anti-POC rhetoric**, and even denied or falsified genocides. Money speaks. He put his money where his mouth is.

## The Principle: You Reap What You Sow

> **"You reap what you sow. Live by the sword, die by the sword."**

Charlie Kirk sowed outrage, anti-empathy, and programs that normalized harm toward others.  
He made peaceful change harder and harder, and as President **John F. Kennedy** said in his 1962 American University commencement address:

> **"Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable."**

## The Breaking Point

Fighting fire with fire is something I was never taught.  
But when a monumental problem is left **boiling and festering**, there comes a breaking point — a threshold that gets crossed.  

Those who haven’t been heard for so long are bound to explode in anger and frustration — and yes, that can turn violent.  
It’s human nature, and it’s to be expected.  
These reactions aren’t random — they’re **symptoms of the true problem:**  
> Injustice, and a system that refuses to hold itself accountable.

## Recognition of Consequence

So when you ask *why* or play the blame game, saying how “bad it is to celebrate death” —  
**This is not a celebration but a recognition of consequence.**

And for those who *are* celebrating — flaunt it.  
Because we know, and I know, that the threshold was broken a long time ago.

## No Remorse

That’s why I don’t feel remorse for what happened to Charlie Kirk. He did not deseerve to die how he did. No one does. But at the same time, 
he spent years fueling division and verbally attacking the very people now accused of “crossing the line.”  
He didn’t want his mind changed. He refused to show compassion.  

- "How you die does not redeem how you lived." - Dr. Howard John Wesley

He built a machine and a platform — and in today’s age, influence is power.  
That machine thrived on outrage, and when you pump that energy into the world for a decade,  
you can’t be shocked when it comes back around.

## Compassion Fatigue

This said — I don’t believe he “deserved” a public assassination.  

But people eventually run out of compassion.  
They run out of patience.  
They run out of empathy when they’ve been on the receiving end of abuse —  
verbal, political, systemic — year after year.  

At some point, **the universe cashes the check you’ve been writing**.  

We can’t act like feeling nothing for the man is some unthinkable evil.  
We are all human — right, wrong, better, or worse.

## The Inevitable Result

Charlie Kirk’s death may be tragic, but it’s also fitting.  
It’s the **logical endpoint** of the energy he put into the world.  

This isn’t about celebrating violence —  
**it’s about understanding consequence.**  

He made peaceful change impossible, and what happened was the inevitable result.
