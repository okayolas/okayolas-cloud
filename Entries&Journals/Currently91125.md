## Our Current Moment

- Moral Exhaustion: People are tired of constantly extending compassion to figures they see as harmful. Compassion fatigue is real.

- Accountability vs. Revenge: There’s a tension between wanting justice and simply celebrating harm done to someone you believe deserved it.

- Normalization of Political Violence: The idea that violence is inevitable when peaceful means are blocked is becoming mainstream — dangerous but deeply felt.

- Loss of Shared Moral Baseline: Some call for humanity and forgiveness, while others double down on calls for more retribution — reflecting a split cultural psyche.

- Digital Amplification: Social media makes these reactions visible, contagious, and more extreme, accelerating polarization.

- Spiritual Crossroads: Some turn to religion, others to radical politics, others to humor — all are coping mechanisms for a society that feels unstable.
