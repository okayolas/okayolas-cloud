# The Power of Gaslighting Yourself — Why Changing Your Attitude Matters More Than Changing Your Effort

## The Setup: Two Ways to See the Same Day
**Version 1 (Effort-Focused):**  
On Tuesdays, I **have to** wake up at 7 a.m. to make it to my 9 a.m. class.  
I **have to** go to bed early the night before.  
I **have to** make tea, take allergy medicine, and drag myself across campus for 20 minutes hoping I’m not late.  

**Version 2 (Attitude-Focused):**  
On Tuesdays, I **get to** wake up at 7 a.m. while it’s quiet and peaceful.  
I **get to** enjoy a slow morning, make a warm cup of tea, and take medicine that helps me feel good all day.  
I **get to** walk outside, breathe fresh air, maybe even get to class early — headphones on, *Juna* by Clairo playing, enjoying the morning.  

This is the exact same situation — but seen through a different lens.

## Obligations or Privileges?
I’m not a morning person by any means — but when we start to see our obligations as privileges, life feels lighter.  
We live in a stressful world — that’s real — but at a certain point, **pressure is a privilege.**  

Getting an education.  
Having a job.  
Managing a home.  
Showing up for people you care about.  

Yes, these are responsibilities. But they’re also opportunities we’re lucky to have.

## The Problem: Trying Harder Isn’t Always the Answer
When life gets overwhelming, we often default to:  
- “Push harder.”  
- “Double down.”  
- “Beat yourself up until you get it done.”  

But what if the problem isn’t effort — it’s **mindset**?

## Gaslighting Yourself (in a Good Way)
I call it *gaslighting yourself* — in a good way.  

- Reframing the situation  
- Telling yourself the hard thing is actually a hidden blessing  
- Choosing to believe the better story until it becomes true  

It might sound fake at first — but over time, your brain catches up. Your performance actually improves because you’ve shifted the story you live by.

## The Science
Psychologist **Carol Dweck’s work on growth mindset** shows:  
- People who believe challenges are opportunities perform better  
- Not because they work harder — but because they view failure as feedback, not a dead end  
- They use effort as a tool, not as punishment  

---

## Same Effort, Different Results
Two students study for the same exam for three hours a day:  
- **Student A:** Sees class as a chore, doubts themselves, dreads the work  
- **Student B:** Stays curious, asks questions, believes they can improve  

Who learns more? Who stays focused? Who retains more?  
**Same effort. Different outcome. All because of attitude.**

## Athletes Get It
The best athletes under pressure aren’t always the hardest workers — they’re the ones who:  
- Stay calm and focused when things go wrong  
- Reframe pressure as excitement, not anxiety  

That’s an attitude shift, not an effort upgrade.

## A Personal Example
This semester, I was falling behind — multiple projects, no sleep, every task felt like a mountain.  
I kept telling myself: “You’re lazy. Just push harder.”  

But the more I forced myself, the worse I performed.  

Then I asked:  
> “What if I’m not lazy? What if I’m just overwhelmed — and that’s okay?”

I didn’t change my workload — I changed the voice in my head.  
Suddenly, I had momentum again — not because I worked harder, but because I **believed** I could handle it.

## Effort vs. Attitude
Effort is fuel.  
Attitude is the steering wheel.  
You can floor the gas pedal all day — but if your mindset is misaligned, you’ll just drive in circles.  

---

## Practical Shifts You Can Make
- Change **“I have to” → “I get to.”**  
- Change **“I’m behind” → “I’m learning.”**  
- Change **“I’m not doing enough” → “I’m doing my best with what I have.”**  

These aren’t just motivational quotes — they’re mental reprogramming.  

---

## The Takeaway
Changing your attitude doesn’t mean giving up on effort — it means stopping the self-blame cycle.  

When your mindset shifts:  
- You feel energized instead of drained  
- You become more creative  
- You stop dreading tasks and start engaging with them  

You start showing up as your **best self** — not your most exhausted self.  

---

## Final Thought
The next time you feel stuck, pause and ask:  
> “What’s the story I’m telling myself about this situation? Can I tell a better one?”  

Because sometimes the most powerful thing you can do isn’t to try harder —  
it’s to **believe that what you’re already doing is enough**.  

Pressure will always exist — but so will privilege and opportunity.  
When you can say, *“I get to do this today,”* that’s when life starts to change.

**Thank you.**
