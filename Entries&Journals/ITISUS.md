# 🌍 It Is Us  

Whether we like it or not.  
Whether we want to or not.  
Whether we agree, disagree, or can’t decide.  

We make mistakes we feel we shouldn’t or do not mean.  
We feel each other’s pain.  
We regret, we mourn, we lose — and we keep going.  
What else is there to do but figure it out and keep going?

**It is us.**  
It will forever be us.  
It will be us until it is not.  

This planet is a miracle.  
We are a miracle.  

Whether we like it or not, we have no choice...  
we are bound together.  

We will be in this together  
until our earth dies a natural death  
or until we destroy it  
with the countless ways we’ve created to do so.  

**It will always be us.**  

Love your neighbor.  
And if you can’t, at least be open to them.
