## ðŸ‘‹ WELCOME  

i make music. i write things down.  
sometimes they rhyme, sometimes they donâ€™t.  

this page is my campfire â€”  
a place to sit, read, listen,  
and maybe leave something of your own behind.  

the poems, journals, and sounds here  
arenâ€™t just mine â€” theyâ€™re an invitation.  
a reminder that weâ€™re all figuring it out,  
and that we get to do it together.  

if youâ€™re here, welcome.  
**pull up a chair, stay awhile.**
