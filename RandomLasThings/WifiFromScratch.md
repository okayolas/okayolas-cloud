# Building a Wi-Fi Network from Scratch

## 1. Understand the Core of Wi-Fi
- Based on the **IEEE 802.11** standard, which defines how wireless signals are transmitted, modulated, and secured.
- Uses radio waves in:
  - **2.4 GHz** and **5 GHz** bands
  - Newer Wi-Fi 6E uses **6 GHz** too.
- Requires:
  - **Transmitter (Access Point)**
  - **Receiver (Client devices)**

---

## 2. Required Components
If building from bare metal:
- **RF hardware** â€“ radio transmitter/receiver for Wi-Fi frequencies.
- **Antenna** â€“ for sending and receiving signals.
- **Networking board** â€“ microcontroller (ESP32, Raspberry Pi) or custom PCB with Wi-Fi chipset.
- **Firmware** â€“ low-level code to handle 802.11 packets.
- **Host system** â€“ connects Wi-Fi to the internet (server, modem, or simulated network).

## 3. Build or Program the Access Point

### A. Off-the-Shelf Hardware + Custom Firmware
- Get a router supporting **OpenWrt** or **DD-WRT**.
- Install custom firmware for full control over network behavior.

### B. Full Scratch Build (Embedded Development)
- Use a development board with Wi-Fi (ESP8266/ESP32 or similar).
- Write firmware to enable **SoftAP mode** (software access point).
- Implement **DHCP & NAT** so connected devices get IP addresses and internet access.

---

## 4. Connect to an Internet Backbone (Optional)
- **Option 1:** Connect AP to a wired modem or upstream internet source.
- **Option 2:** Create a mesh network where one node has internet and relays to others.

---

## 5. Configure the Network
- **SSID:** Network name.
- **Security:** WPA2/WPA3 encryption.
- **IP Range:** Set DHCP server to assign IPs (e.g., `192.168.1.x`).
- **Routing:** Configure NAT so devices can reach the internet.

---

## 6. Test and Optimize
- Use tools like `iperf3` to measure range and speed.
- Adjust:
  - Antenna placement
  - Transmission power
  - Channel to avoid interference
- Keep firmware updated.

> ðŸ’¡ If you want a beginner-friendly approach, you can build a working Wi-Fi network using an **ESP32** and a few lines of code without diving deep into RF engineering.
