## “Last One Best One”

Last one, best one is a phrase Jaden may or may not have invented—but he definitely made it his own. It’s a mindset: finish strong. From karate to basketball, from childhood into adulthood, Jaden has carried this phrase through every chapter—elementary school, high school, college, and now, his grown-up years. The last one has to be the best one. It is a point of transition. It is a rebirth almost. Like a calipitter  morphing into a butterfly. It is making the most of the moment that will pass, surrendering and letting it go. Last One Best One means to make the most of the day and earn the sunset. 

This album is by Olas. While it was created during Jaden’s final year of college, it’s not about college. It’s about the life that happened around it—the growth, the pressure, the changes, the love, the loss, and the realization that adulthood doesn’t start all at once. It creeps in through responsibility, heartbreak, and hard choices.

As Jaden juggles two majors, a part-time job, a relationship, personal projects, school, and leadership in a student organization, the weight begins to pile up. Expectations from collaborators, friends, professors—and especially his parents—start to blur his focus. Olas becomes lost. Completely lost his way. In trying to hold it all together, he begins to lose sight of what truly matters, pushing away the people who love him most—his best friends, his girlfriend, his mentors, and loses touch with family.

Eventually, he sees it: he’s been taking the most important parts of his life for granted—his relationship, his health, his passions. He’s still creating, still achieving, still collecting unforgettable moments, but inside, Olas has lost his voice, his heart, and spirit. 

Last One Best One is about that final evolution before adulthood. It’s about realizing life isn’t fair to anyone, and still choosing love, compassion, and presence despite the noise. Even in the chaos, there’s room to grow. Room to feel. Room to begin again. Room to make this final frontier, the best one by any means necessary. Not to mention, this was Jaden's final project in school.

This album is introspective, colorful, exciting, a slow burn, and empowering. It’s Jaden and Olas—aka Las—signing off from a pivotal chapter, and stepping boldly into what’s next.
