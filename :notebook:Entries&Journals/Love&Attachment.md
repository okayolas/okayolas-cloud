# Love vs. Attachment

## Attachment (The Bond/System)
An innate **security-seeking system** that activates under stress to keep us close to key others (a “safe haven” / “secure base”).  
- In adulthood, it shows up along two dimensions:  
  - **Anxiety** → fear of abandonment  
  - **Avoidance** → discomfort with closeness  
- Attachment can shift with new experiences.

## Love (The Experience/Relationship)
Best described by **three components** (Sternberg’s Triangular Theory of Love):  
- **Intimacy** – emotional closeness  
- **Passion** – desire  
- **Commitment** – choosing each other over time  
These combine in different proportions over the life of a relationship.

## Key Differences (Love ≠ Attachment)

### Goal Orientation
- **Attachment:** Regulates felt safety, calms fear, reduces distress  
- **Love:** Organizes how partners connect and build a life together  

### Typical Behaviors Under Stress
- **Attachment-Anxious:** Hyperactivate – seek reassurance, ruminate, fear loss  
- **Attachment-Avoidant:** Deactivate – pull back, suppress emotion, prize independence  
- **Love:** Can stay steady if commitment + intimacy guide constructive repair  

### Time Course
- **Attachment:** Relatively stable but modifiable with supportive partners (“partner buffering”)  
- **Love:** Components rebalance over time (passion can wax and wane, commitment often grows)

### Focus of Attention
- **Attachment (esp. insecure):** “Am I safe/valued?”  
- **Love:** “Are we nurturing closeness, desire, and a shared future?”

## Important Similarities
- Both are normal parts of adult bonds

- Partners’ attachment styles shape each other’s feelings & behaviors (dyads matter)

## Quick Self-Check

When you’re upset, do you mostly…  
- 🔎 **Seek constant reassurance, fear abandonment?** → leaning attachment **anxiety**  
- 🔎 **Go numb, minimize needs, prefer distance?** → leaning attachment **avoidance**  
- 🔎 **Ask for/offer support, repair conflicts, feel safe?** → more **secure**

Day-to-day, is the relationship marked by…  
- ❤️ **Mutual caretaking, shared goals, choosing each other?** → signals of **love**  
- ⚠️ **Reassurance cycles, jealousy, withdrawal/stonewalling?** → signals of **insecure attachment**

---

## Refinements to Your Notes
- “**Love is choosing someone every day**” → maps to **commitment** (keep this)  
- “**Respect, kindness, understanding, growing together**” → intimacy + caregiving behaviors  
- “**Attachment needs reassurance / can be desperate**” → describes **anxious attachment**, not all attachment

## What to Do With This (Practical Steps)

1. **Name your pattern** (anxious/avoidant/secure) and share it — language reduces blame  
2. **Practice “secure moves”:**  
   - Clear bids for comfort  
   - Prompt support when asked  
   - Warm, consistent responsiveness  
3. **Build love’s triangle on purpose:**  
   - Schedule intimacy (time, curiosity)  
   - Protect passion (novelty, play)  
   - Make commitments explicit (rituals, agreements)  
4. **Expect change:** both attachment security and love’s balance can shift with consistent, supportive experiences
